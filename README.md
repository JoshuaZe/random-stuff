## Random stuff I've been working on

Here's a storage of useful code I'm sharing at the request of friends and colleagues. Each folder contains a snippet or experiment with a different model or library. A short description of each folder follows:

1. **graphviz_test:** a small experiment with graphviz and networkx for drawing graphs.
2. **partial_dependence:** experiments with partial dependence packages on a synthetic dataset.
3. **probability_calibration:** calibrating the probability of tree-based models with a stacked logistic regression
